# How to

## Raspberry PI

This is probably the most common use case, so here is a quick example of how to install it on a raspberry pi.

 1. Get a raspberry PI with raspbian on it. We recommend and use raspberry PI 3 s, due to their speed. This computer will be called `TARGET` throughout the tutorial.
 2. Download a [release](https://github.com/lnstempunks/PunkVision/releases) (or [clone](https://github.com/lnstempunks/PunkVision) the latest) on a developer machine. This computer will be called `HOST` throughout the tutorial.
 3. Copy this over to the raspberry pi.
