# PunkVision

A realtime vision program for FRC teams.

## TODO

  + Use [cscore](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vision/other.html) for streaming to the driver station (right now, you have to open a web browser)
  + Add documentation, and a formal LaTeX paper
  + Provide raspi images for teams to use
  + Add Makefile to install correct packages, and detect some things (probably not enough to warrant a ./configure step)


## BUGS

Please report bugs to the [issues](https://github.com/LN-STEMpunks/PunkVision/issues)

## TESTS

Some could be hard to implement (because it needs to be ran live most of the time), and every camera is different.
